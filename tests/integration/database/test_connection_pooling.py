"""
Database Connection Pooling and Session Management Testing Suite

This comprehensive test suite validates SQLAlchemy connection pool configuration, session lifecycle
management, and concurrent database operations for the Flask migration from Node.js. Ensures optimal
database connectivity through psycopg2 adapter configuration, validates connection pool sizing and
timeout settings, and tests connection health validation with pool_pre_ping capabilities for
production deployment readiness.

Test Coverage:
- SQLAlchemy QueuePool configuration with configurable parameters per Section 6.2.5.2
- PostgreSQL psycopg2 adapter integration testing for connectivity optimization per Section 6.2.1
- Connection pool sizing validation (pool_size, max_overflow, pool_timeout) per Section 6.2.5.2
- Connection health validation with pool_pre_ping=True for containerized environments per Section 6.2.5.2
- Concurrent session testing ensuring thread-safe database operations per Section 5.2.4
- Connection lifecycle testing including recycling and stale connection management per Section 6.2.5.2

Migration Context:
Validates that Flask-SQLAlchemy connection pooling meets or exceeds the concurrent user load
capabilities of the original Node.js implementation while maintaining zero functional regression
during the technology migration process.
