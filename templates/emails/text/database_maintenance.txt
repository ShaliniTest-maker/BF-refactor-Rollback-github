FLASK-MIGRATE OPERATION DETAILS
--------------------------------
Migration Environment Variables:
  DATABASE_URL: {{ database_url_masked or "[CONFIGURED]" }}
  DATABASE_POOL_SIZE: {{ pool_size or "20" }}
  DATABASE_MAX_OVERFLOW: {{ max_overflow or "30" }}
  DATABASE_POOL_TIMEOUT: {{ pool_timeout or "30" }}

  DATABASE_POOL_PRE_PING: {{ pool_pre_ping or "True" }}

Migration Commands Sequence:
  1. Pre-migration backup: pg_dump with timestamp verification
  2. Migration validation: flask db show (review pending migrations)
  3. Execute migration: {{ migration_command or "flask db upgrade" }}
  4. Post-migration validation: Schema consistency check
  5. Performance benchmarking: Query response time validation

SQLALCHEMY CONNECTION POOL MONITORING
--------------------------------------
During Migration:
  - Connection Pool Utilization: Monitor >90% threshold
  - Connection Acquisition Time: Alert if >1000ms
  - Pool Overflow Usage: Track overflow connections
  - Connection Lifecycle: Monitor connection recycling patterns

Connection Pool Health Checks:
  - Active Connection Count vs Pool Capacity
  - Connection Queue Depth and Wait Times
  - Pool Overflow Utilization Metrics
  - Connection Timeout and Error Rates

ROLLBACK PROCEDURES
-------------------
Automatic Rollback Triggers:
  - Migration execution time exceeds {{ rollback_timeout or "30 minutes" }}
  - Database connection pool exhaustion (>95% utilization)
  - Query performance degradation >{{ performance_threshold or "50%" }}
  - Application error rate exceeds {{ error_threshold or "1%" }}

Rollback Execution Steps:
  1. Immediate: Stop migration process (Ctrl+C if interactive)
  2. Database: flask db downgrade {{ previous_version or "[previous_revision]" }}
  3. Verification: Validate schema rollback completion
  4. Health Check: Confirm application connectivity
  5. Performance: Validate query response times
  6. Monitoring: Enable enhanced monitoring for 24h post-rollback

Emergency Rollback (Critical Failures):
  1. Stop Flask application instances
  2. Restore database from backup snapshot
  3. Verify data integrity with checksum validation
  4. Restart application services
  5. Notify incident response team

SYSTEM IMPACT AND SERVICE STATUS
---------------------------------
Affected Services:
{% if affected_services %}
{% for service in affected_services %}
  - {{ service.name }}: {{ service.impact }}
    {% if service.alternative %}Alternative: {{ service.alternative }}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
  - All Flask application endpoints (temporary unavailability)
  - Database read/write operations (migration duration)
  - Background job processing (if applicable)
  - API integrations (connection dependent)
{% endif %}

Monitoring During Maintenance:
  - Health Check Endpoints: /health/liveness, /health/readiness
  - Performance Metrics: CloudWatch Container Insights
  - Error Tracking: Sentry real-time monitoring
  - Infrastructure: AWS ECS/EKS container status

  - API Endpoints: {{ api_availability or "Unavailable during migration window" }}
  - Database Queries: {{ db_availability or "Unavailable during schema changes" }}
  - Authentication: {{ auth_availability or "Auth0 integration maintained" }}
  - File Operations: {{ file_availability or "Unaffected" }}
