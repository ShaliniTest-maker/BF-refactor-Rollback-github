--------------------------------------------------------
1. Enable maintenance mode on Flask application
2. Gracefully drain active connections

Phase 2: Schema Migration Execution ({{phase2_duration}})
----------------------------------------------------------
1. Execute Flask-Migrate upgrade operation
2. Monitor migration progress and performance
3. Validate schema changes against specification
4. Verify data integrity post-migration
5. Update application configuration if required

Flask-Migrate Commands:
- flask db upgrade {{target_version}}
- flask db validate --check-integrity
- flask db performance-test --post-migration

Phase 3: Post-Migration Validation ({{phase3_duration}})
---------------------------------------------------------
1. Execute comprehensive application test suite
2. Verify API endpoint functionality
3. Validate authentication and authorization systems
4. Confirm monitoring and logging operations
5. Disable maintenance mode and restore service

Validation Commands:
- flask test --security-validation
- flask auth test --auth0-integration
- flask health-check --comprehensive
- flask maintenance disable

DOWNTIME IMPACT ASSESSMENT
===========================

Service Availability:
- Planned downtime: {{planned_downtime}}

RISK MITIGATION
================

Identified Risks and Mitigation Strategies:

   Contingency: Manual intervention procedures documented

2. Extended Downtime
   Risk Level: {{downtime_risk}}
   Mitigation: Phased migration approach, real-time monitoring
   Contingency: Service degradation mode, partial restoration

3. Data Integrity Issues
   Risk Level: {{integrity_risk}}
   Mitigation: Comprehensive backup strategy, validation checkpoints
   Contingency: Point-in-time recovery, data reconciliation procedures

4. Authentication System Impact
   Risk Level: {{auth_risk}}
   Mitigation: Auth0 integration testing, session preservation
   Contingency: Emergency authentication bypass, user re-authentication
